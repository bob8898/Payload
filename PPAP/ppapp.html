    <h1>PPAP Payload Proposal</h1>
<p class="Prop">PPAP, one of our most unique payload concepts yet, is based off of a powered paraglider. The construction of our payload would create multiple engineering challenges that we would gain knowledge about how to overcome them.  Testing the payload will very likely lead to failures that we will learn from.  These experiences will help us better understand our payload and overcome the engineering challenges.  We have created a list of required materials, and based upon what we recovered from previous payloads, we will be able to reuse most of our  components.  Any additional materials our team and parent mentors are willing to self fund.  We are just happy to have the opportunity to be involved in the challenge.

The team chose this design because we feel it is unique, and its simplicity may provide us with an advantage over other competitors.  We have high hopes for this concept, as it has capabilities to navigate on a 2 dimensional plane with differential thrust, rather than an engine, rudder, and other control surfaces which would add to the complexity of the design.  If successful, the team believes this this could be used on a larger scale to deliver food, water, medicine or other resources to exact locations, in such situations as natural disaster relief.  Another reason why we chose this payload over a fixed wing glider or other concepts is  because of its compact nature.  This would allow for the possibility of another team having an opportunity to participate by piggybacking payloads.  Other concepts may require the entire payload tube.  If we  are fortunate enough to win the competition, we would like to use the money to further the STEM programs at our school.
