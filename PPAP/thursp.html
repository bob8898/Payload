    <h1>THURS Payload Proposal</h1>
<p class="Prop">The THURS has two main goals. Goal #1 is to compare the data from two temperature sensors with different thermal masses, relative to altitude. Measurements will be taken 10 times per second. The sensors we have chosen are a K-type thermocouple (lower thermal mass) and a Dallas DS18B20 (higher thermal mass).  Results will be recorded with a microcontroller based data logger. We will store temperature data and altitude data on a microSD card for graphing purposes after recovery. The graphed data will help us compare the magnitude of the difference between readings of each temperature sensor.  This information will prove that having a low thermal mass temperature sensor is important for situations where temperatures change quickly.

Goal #2 is to have a redundant recovery system to make sure our payload is successfully recovered. Matthew has attended several launches, and has seen the common problem of not being able to recover payloads, resulting in lost time, money, energy, and data. Our recovery system has many features, including a high decibel alarm, 1200 lumen pulsing white LEDs, a long neon green ribbon tail, and GPS telemetry to a mobile receiver at 433 MHz.  With these systems, we will have a greater chance of successful recovery of our payload.
