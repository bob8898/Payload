    <h1>DPSR Payload Proposal</h1>
<p class="Prop">Our team is very passionate and excited for this possible opportunity. We believe this project is unique and presents some interesting engineering challenges. The team understands that space exploration requires lots of power in a small space. Our payload will be exploring methods of recovering wasted kinetic energy during the descent phase. Systems like this could be used on future Mars explorations and the Orion capsule. This would result in less wasted power, reducing the size and weight of other on-board power systems. We believe that our successful payload last year has demonstrated that we are committed, and understand what it takes to construct a working payload. In fact, because of our successful recovery last year, many of our components can be reused this year, with the hopes of keeping costs low. However, we also learned that things donâ€™t always go as planned, and failure is an important part of the design process and offers more learning experiences. We are also committed to building a payload half the size of the available payload tube, with the hopes of providing another team with an opportunity to participate.
